; The line below provides a location reference for the
; rest of the program. The BIOS loads this image starting
; at 0x7c00. If we don't provide the line below, we have 
; to manually offset all our addresses by 0x7c00. This is
; tedious so we add this to make things easier. So for
; example every time we access the 0x0 memory location
; from now on, it will actually be 0x7c00 as the BIOS
; sees it.
[org 0x7c00]

; Here we're setting the data segment to 0x0
; (or effectively 0x7c00 as the BIOS sees it).
; The data segment contains all the constants
; and data in our program. If we ommit this block
; the code will still work in QEMU but won't
; work in actual hardware. I'm still not quite
; sure why but I think QEMU automatically
; resets the data segment for us whereas
; in actual hardware (or at least the old
; laptop that I was using) this has to be set
; manually.

; BOOT_DRIVE is a global variable that we have
; defined (see towards the bottom of this file
; where global variables are defined). dl is
; where BIOS stores our boot drive. The boot
; drive is just a number that BIOS assigns to
; the drive that we are booting from (USB, DVD, etc)
; We don't really care how this number is assigned
; or what it inherently means. All we care about
; is that BIOS identifies our boot drive with
; this number and later we need this number to
; refer to out boot device.

; Here we are setting up the stack. bp is the stack
; base pointer (bottom of stack). This value does
; not change automatically and unless we change it
; manually it's fixed for the rest of the program.
; sp is the stack pointer and it points to the top
; of the stack. This pointer does change implicitly.
; For example when we use push and pop functions, this
; pointer gets incremented or decremeneted accordingly.
; The stack grows "backwards" (ie towards 0x0). So the
; stack pointer is decremented every time we push items
; on the stack, therefore we must initialize our stack far
; away from the location of our program to ensure we
; don't overwrite our code. Here we are setting the base
; at 0x9000 (ie far away from where out kernel is going
; to be (ie 0x1000). And since the stack is empty initially,
; we set sp equal to bp.
